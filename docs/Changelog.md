  to keep before then."

## 2024.0.3

Deployed 2024-01-18

  of nearly every page.

## Prior to UB Versioning

Before implementing UB versioning separate from CMU versioning, there were many improvements made to UB's variant of
Autolab.

### January 2024

- CMU Merge: Updates made upstream by CMU from May 23, 2023 through January 8th, 2024 have been merged into UB
  Autolab.
- Security/performance: Schedulers were disabled to improve both security and performance. Nobody ever used this
  feature, but it posed an arbitrary code execution risk.
- Bug fix: For group submissions, the submitter is the owner of the Tango job, rather than the first member of the
  group.
- Literature: The capitalization of "Autolab Self-Service Portal" was standardized.
- Literature: The capitalization of "Autolab" was standardized. (There was only one location where it was incorrect.)
- Performance: Heap analytics has been removed. We never used this, and it was only causing silent client-side errors.

### December 2023

- New feature: The "Manage Submissions 2.0" page has been implemented with much faster performance than the previous
  version (~78x faster).
- Convenience improvement: After a bulk grade import, instructors are offered to release all grades immediately.
- Bug fix: Update the frontend to allow annotations without a problem specified (for general comments without scores).
- Bug fix: IP addresses from UB VPN users will be logged correctly.

### October 2023

- Bug fix: Semantic feedback won't be parsed as JSON unless it's a Ruby hash (JSON object).
- Convenience improvement: If a user was created automatically without having their first name specified, their
  first name will automatically be updated the first time they log in.
- UI improvement: The maximum total score is included in the submissions table header.
- UI improvement: The "since" datestamp formatting has been improved on the Tango jobs page.
- Bug fix: Instructors can view detailed information about Tango jobs for their own courses.
- Bug fix: Submissions can always be downloaded, even if handins are disabled.
- UI improvement: A detailed error message is shown if a student submits when they aren't allowed to.
    - Perhaps they loaded the page before the due date, but clicked submit after the due date.

### September 2023

- New feature: UB Course Sections have been implemented to granularly specify assessment start and end times for each
  section.
- New feature: Attachments can be restricted to only be available during a student's lecture/section time.
- New feature: Per-assessment section offsets can be specified.
- Literature: Documentation for the UB Course Sections feature has been linked in the relevant settings panel.
- Bug fix: The author of an annotation will not be updated if the annotation is moved.
- Bug fix: Annotation authors cannot be spoofed.
- Security improvement: The handin directory and handin filename are validated more strictly.
- Security improvement: The writeup and handout cannot be set to a file.
  Resolves [this path traversal vulnerability](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/security/advisories/GHSA-h8wq-ghfq-5hfx).
- Bug fix: Tango will receive a unique settings.json filename to avoid collisions between students.
- UI improvement: GitHub submissions will be the default handin tab, if available.
- UI improvement: 100 GitHub repos (API maximum) will be queried from GitHub instead of 30 to make it easier to find
  one in the dropdown list.
- API update: Course section management (non-public) endpoints have been added.

### August 2023

- New feature: The Grader Assignment Tool (part of the Autolab Self-Service Portal) API endpoints have been created.
- Convenience improvement: Multiple problems can be added to an assessment rapidly without returning to the edit page.
- Bug fix: First and last names have a maximum length enforced.
- Convenience improvement: Instructors are warned when an assessment has an autograder but no problems.
- UI improvement: An "extra credit" warning displays when manually grading a problem with a higher score than the
  maximum. This doesn't prevent saving because some professors want to assign extra credit.

### July 2023

- Bug fix: Rapid submissions won't result in duplicate version numbers.
- Literature: Links to general documentation have been added to the contact/resources page.

### May and June 2023

We began working on the new version of UB Autolab in May 2023. The previous version was over 5 years old and very
outdated. CMU added many new features and fixed many security issues since our original deployment.

This major renovation included:

- Restyling the entire application to fit UB's blue color scheme
- Updating wording and links throughout
- Implementing Shibboleth authentication
- Improving logging
- Adding settings.json to every submission
- Disabling self-registration
- Configuring the Docker environment (spanning 7 different servers!)
