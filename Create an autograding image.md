# Create an autograding image

An autograding image is a template for the sandboxed environment that submissions will run in. It defines which operating system will be used and which software is available while running an autograder. It should not contain any project-specific information.

If you're using a common tech stack, there's a good chance you won't need to create a custom image. You can see all the current images in our [Autograding Images repository](https://github.com/UB-CSE-IT/Autograding-Images).

Before creating your own image, it's a good idea to be familiar with [The autograding process](The%20autograding%20process.md).
