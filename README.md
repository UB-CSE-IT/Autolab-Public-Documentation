# Autolab Public Documentation

## Introduction

Autolab is an open-source automated code grading platform developed at Carnegie Mellon University and used by
universities around the world. The UB CSE IT department maintains a customized variant of Autolab for use in our
courses. It's hosted on premises at UB, and you can access it at <https://autolab.cse.buffalo.edu>.

This repository will serve as a guide, primarily for instructors, on how to use Autolab.
