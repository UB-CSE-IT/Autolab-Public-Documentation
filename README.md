## Sample Autograders

Sample autograders are located in the `sample_files` directory. These are referenced throughout the documentation. Some
autograder directories contain multiple correct and/or incorrect solutions to demonstrate how the grader works in
different situations.

* [autograder0](sample_files/autograder0) is the most minimal autograder just to give you an idea of the format.
* [autograder1](sample_files/autograder1) is a more realistic autograder that grades 3 problems differently, but it's
  not robust enough for real use.
* [autograder2](sample_files/autograder2) demonstrates how to use the settings.json file to get metadata about the
  submission.
* [autograder3](sample_files/autograder3) demonstrates how to grade an embedded form submission.
* [autograder4](sample_files/autograder4) demonstrates how to create an embedded form that allows submitting a file.
